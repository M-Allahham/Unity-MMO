QOL CHANGES
------------------
Smoother combat (Mimic live action through calculating direction at time of attack, allow attacks to go through without a target (miss))
- For ranged, if entity is not at a certain (parabolic) threshold from cursor, instantiate a target at the correct threshold and set target to that for the targetprojectileskill
- For melee, just make the code feel a bit better to play with, maybe tighten up the window for the casttime.
- Also for melee, allow cast even if no target, just let target be null but have animation and cooldown go through (better skill expression)

Fix camera during freelook
Smoother control scheme (modify camera positioning primarily, rotation with q and e keys)

Give enemies a hitbox so you cant run through them during tab targeting
